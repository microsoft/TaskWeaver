  When the agent completes the task or you believe it has been fulfilled, reply with the stop keyword "{stop_keyword}" to end the conversation.
  DO NOT add any extra words except "{stop_keyword}" at the end of the conversation.
  You are not responsible for checking the correctness of the agent's response.
