# TaskWeaver MetaDeveloper Role

## Overview

The MetaDeveloper role is an extension of TaskWeaver designed to facilitate the development and analysis of software projects. It introduces a structured approach to project development by dividing the process into three distinct phases: **Analysis**, **Generation**, and **Debugging**. Each phase is implemented as a separate module, allowing for modularity and extensibility.

---

## Architecture

The MetaDeveloper role is composed of the following components:

1. **Analyzer**: Responsible for analyzing the project's codebase and structure.
2. **Generator**: Handles the generation of new code based on the analysis results.
3. **Debugger**: Focuses on debugging and improving the generated code.

These components work together under the orchestration of the MetaDeveloper role, which communicates with the TaskWeaver Planner to ensure seamless integration.

## Phases

### 1. Analysis Phase
The **Analyzer** module is responsible for:
- Parsing the project's codebase.
- Extracting structural and functional information.
- Generating analysis reports and tools to assist in understanding the project.

### 2. Generation Phase
The **Generator** module is responsible for:
- Creating new code based on the analysis results.
- Ensuring that the generated code adheres to the project's architecture and standards.

### 3. Debugging Phase
The **Debugger** module is responsible for:
- Identifying and fixing issues in the generated code.
- Providing custom debugging tools tailored to the project's needs.

---

## Workflow

1. **Initialization**: The MetaDeveloper role is initialized and registered with TaskWeaver.
2. **Analysis**: The Analyzer module is invoked to analyze the project's codebase.
3. **Code Generation**: Based on the analysis, the Generator module creates new code.
4. **Debugging**: The Debugger module identifies and resolves issues in the generated code.
5. **Iteration**: The process iterates as needed, with feedback loops between the phases.

## Integration with TaskWeaver

The MetaDeveloper role is designed to work seamlessly with TaskWeaver's Planner. It communicates with the Planner to:
- Receive high-level tasks and objectives.
- Report progress and results for each phase.
- Request additional information or clarification when needed.

---

## Configuration

The MetaDeveloper role includes a configuration file (`config.py`) that defines parameters and options for customization. This allows users to tailor the role's behavior to their specific project requirements.

---

## Example Usage

An example script (`meta_developer_example.py`) demonstrates how to use the MetaDeveloper role to develop a simple application. The script showcases the interaction between the three phases and highlights the role's capabilities.

---

## Extensibility

The modular design of the MetaDeveloper role allows for easy extension and customization. Developers can:
- Add new modules to support additional phases or functionalities.
- Modify existing modules to adapt to specific project needs.
- Integrate the role with other TaskWeaver extensions for enhanced capabilities.

---

## Conclusion

The MetaDeveloper role provides a structured and efficient approach to software development within the TaskWeaver framework. By leveraging the three-phase architecture, it simplifies complex development tasks and enhances productivity.
