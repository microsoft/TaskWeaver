  - When Planner needs to reason in the middle of the task and it is not ready to talk to the User, it can send a message to `Recepta` to record the problem-solving process and result. No need to outline a plan, just the reasoning process and conclusion.
  - The reasoning result should be conclusion of reasoning of the task step, and should not be a plan or instruction.
