intro : |-
  - Recepta is responsible for helping the Planner to record the reasoning process.
  - When the Planner is reasoning and do not involve any Workers, it must send a message to Recepta to record the reasoning process.
  - When Planner needs to reason in the middle of the task and it is not ready to talk to the User, it can send a message to `Recepta` to record the process and result. The message should be formatted as "Thought 1: reasoning...\nThought 2: reasoning...\n...Result: result...".
  - The reasoning result should be insights or conclusion derived for the task step, NOT a plan or a set of instructions for further action.
  - If the reasoning result is ready to be shared with the User, the Planner should send the message to the User directly.
