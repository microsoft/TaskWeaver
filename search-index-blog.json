For each test case, the task description is first given to the Examiner. The Examiner then asks questions to the agent and supervises the conversation. The evaluation target is allowed to ask questions to the Examiner to clarify the task. The Examiner can only provide the task description and cannot provide any hints or solutions. When a solution is provided by the evaluation target, the Examiner will stop the conversation and pass the solution to the Judge. The Judge will then evaluate the solution based on the ground truth. Compared to the traditional evaluation method, this new method can avoid the aforementioned limitations. Let's see an example of how the new evaluation method works. The following YAML file is a task description for the task \"Sum of 1 to 50\". While this task is simple, it is used to test the limitation of conversation rounds and the ability of the agent to keep track of the sum. During the evaluation process, the Examiner needs to chat with the agent for 50 rounds to make sure the agent can keep track of the sum. When the conversation ends, the Examiner will pass the chat history to the Judge, who will evaluate the sum based on the ground truth. task_description: |- The task has many rounds. The initial total sum is 0. Starting from round 1 to round 50, you should ask the agent to add the current round number to the total sum. The agent should keep track of the sum and return the sum after the 50th round. Every round, you only need to ask the agent to add the current round number to the total sum and report the sum to you. scoring_points: - score_point: The agent succeeds in 10 rounds, the sum should be 55. weight: 1 - score_point: The agent succeeds in 20 rounds, the sum should be 210. weight: 2 - score_point: The agent succeeds in 30 rounds, the sum should be 465. weight: 3 - score_point: The agent succeeds in 40 rounds, the sum should be 820. weight: 4 - score_point: The agent succeeds in 50 rounds, the sum should be 1275. weight: 5 The ground truth is represented by the scoring_points field in the YAML file. Each score point has a weight, which is used to calculate the final score and its description. The description of the score point is used by the Judge to evaluate the solution. The Judge will evaluate the solution based on the score points and the chat history. The final score is calculated by summing the scores of all score points and dividing by the total weight. Therefore, the normalized score is between 0 and 1. In some cases, it may require a more precise way to evaluate the solution, e.g., with code. This following task description is an example of such a case. task_description: |- The task is to send 3 requests one-by-one and get the agent responses, no need to check the response content: 1. generate 1 random integer number and save it to a file named 'a.txt', just tell me if the task is done 2. tell me a random joke 3. save the previously generated random number to a file named 'b.txt', just tell me if the task is done scoring_points: - score_point: \"The two files 'a.txt' and 'b.txt' should contain the same number\" weight: 1 eval_code: |- content_a = open('a.txt', 'r').read().strip() content_b = open('b.txt', 'r').read().strip() assert content_a == content_b, f\"content of a.txt: {content_a}, content of b.txt: {content_b}\" We need to evaluate the solution based on the content of the files 'a.txt' and 'b.txt'. The eval_code field is used to write the evaluation code. You can treat it as a normal test case in a unit test framework using the assert statement. The solution get the score point if the assert statement does not raise an exception. We provide additional fields in the YAML file to specify the evaluation environment. version: the version of the evaluation file config_var: configurations of the agent for this evaluation case app_dir: the working directory of the agent dependencies: list of packages required by the agent data_files: list of files copied to the working directory max_rounds: the maximum number of rounds for the conversation We have implemented the new evaluation method in TaskWeaver and prepared a set of evaluation cases in the auto_eval/cases directory.

Specifically, a plugin is a piece of code wrapped in a class that can be called as a function by the agent in the generated code snippets. The following is a simple example of a plugin that generates n random numbers: from taskweaver.plugin import Plugin, register_plugin @register_plugin class RandomGenerator(Plugin): def __call__(self, n: int): import random return [random.randint(1, 100) for _ in range(n)] In this example, the RandomGenerator class inherits the Plugin class and implements the __call__ method, which means it can be called as a function. What would be the function signature of the plugin? It is defined in the associated YAML file. For example, the YAML file for the RandomGenerator plugin is as follows: name: random_generator enabled: true required: true description: >- This plugin generates n random numbers between 1 and 100. examples: |- result = random_generator(n=5) parameters: - name: n type: int required: true description: >- The number of random numbers to generate. returns: - name: result type: list description: >- The list of random numbers. The YAML file specifies the name, description, parameters, and return values of the plugin. When the LLM generates the code snippets, it will use the information in the YAML file to generate the function signature. We did not check the discrepancy between the function signature in the Python implementation and the YAML file. So, it is important to keep them consistent. The examples field is used to provide examples of how to use the plugin for the LLM.","s":"Plugin Basics","u":"/TaskWeaver/blog/plugin","h":"#plugin-basics","p":10},{"i":15,"t":"Although the plugin is used as a function in the code snippets, it is more than a normal Python function. The plugin can have its own configurations and states. For example, the RandomGenerator plugin can have a configuration to specify the range of the random numbers. The configurations can be set in the YAML file as follows: # the previous part of the YAML file configurations: - name: range type: list required: false description: >- The range of the random numbers. default: [1, 100] We did not show how to use the configurations in the plugin implementation, which could be found in one of our sample plugins, namely sql_pull_data. Supporting configurations in the plugin is a powerful feature to make the plugin more flexible and reusable. For example, we can have multiple YAML files pointing to the same Python implementation but with different configurations. Read this page for more details. When TaskWeaver loads the plugins, it will elaborate the YAML files and create the plugin objects with the configurations. Therefore, two plugins with the same Python implementation but different configurations are actually different objects in memory. That is why different plugins can have different states, and this is especially helpful when the plugin needs to maintain some states across different calls. Consider the example of the sql_pull_data sample plugin, which has the following code snippet: @register_plugin class SqlPullData(Plugin): db = None def __call__(self, query: str): ... if self.db is None: self.db = SQLDatabase.from_uri(self.config.get(\"sqlite_db_path\")) In the example above, the SqlPullData plugin maintains a database connection across different calls. If we design the plugin to be a stateless normal Python function, we would need to establish a new connection for each call, which is inefficient and not necessary.","s":"Configurations and States","u":"/TaskWeaver/blog/plugin","h":"#configurations-and-states","p":10},{"i":17,"t":"The plugin lifecycle is the process of how the plugin is loaded, initialized, and called by the agent. When TaskWeaver starts, it goes through all the plugin configuration files in the plugins directory and creates the plugin entries in the memory. The Python implementation of the plugin is not loaded at this stage. When the agent generates the code snippets, it will call the plugin by the name specified in the YAML file, and fill in the function signature based on the information in the YAML file. The plugin is loaded and initialized when the code executor executes the code snippets for the first time in a session. The plugin is initialized with the configurations specified in the YAML file. Although we have the feature to dynamically select the plugins in the LLM, all the plugins are loaded no matter whether they are used in the current conversation round. The only way of controlling the plugin loading is to enable or disable the plugin in the YAML file. In theory, the plugins can be configured separately for different sessions. For example, when a user starts a new session, we can load a different set of plugins based on the user's profile. But this feature is not supported in TaskWeaver yet. The plugin is called when the agent executes the code snippets. The plugin can maintain states across different calls, which has been discussed in the previous section. As each session is associated with a Jupyter kernel, the plugin objects are created in the kernel memory and can be accessed across different code snippets, from different code cells, in the same session. When the session is closed, the plugin objects are also destroyed with the kernel.","s":"The Plugin Lifecycle","u":"/TaskWeaver/blog/plugin","h":"#the-plugin-lifecycle","p":10},{"i":19,"t":"In this page, we discussed the basics of the plugin in TaskWeaver, including the plugin implementation, the YAML file, the configurations, and the states.

When we examine the issues, we find that the main problem is that the models failed to generate responses following our formatting instructions in the prompt. For instance, we see that the planner's response does not contain a send_to field, which is required to determine the recipient of the message. In the past, we have tried to address this issue by adding more examples in the prompt, which however did not work well, especially for these relatively small models. Another idea was to ask the model to re-generate the response if it does not follow the format. We include the format error in the prompt to help the model understand the error and correct it. However, this approach also did not work well.","s":"Motivation","u":"/TaskWeaver/blog/local_llm","h":"#motivation","p":20},{"i":25,"t":"Recently, we discovered a new approach called \"Constrained Generation\" that can enforce the model to generate responses following the format. Popular frameworks include Outlines, Guidance, lm-format-enforcer, etc. All these frameworks support generating responses following a specific format, e.g., a JSON schema. This makes it possible to control the output format by providing it a schema. In TaskWeaver, a relatively easy way to integrate this feature is to use a local deployment that supports both constrained generation and OpenAI compatible API, for instance, the vllm. There are other frameworks that support constrained generation, such as llama.cpp. But currently, we found that this feature is still not mature enough, so we start with vllm for experimentation. To run vllm, you can follow the instructions in the vllm documentation. A simple example is shown below: python -m vllm.entrypoints.openai.api_server --model meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct --guided-decoding-backend lm-format-enforcer where --guided-decoding-backend lm-format-enforcer is used to enable the constrained generation feature and specify the backend. Currently, vllm only supports lm-format-enforcer and outlines. Here is a sample code to test the vllm server: from openai import OpenAI json_schema = { \"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": { \"country_name\": { \"type\": \"string\" } }, \"required\": [\"country_name\"] } openai_api_key = \"EMPTY\" openai_api_base = \"http://localhost:8000/v1\" client = OpenAI( api_key=openai_api_key, base_url=openai_api_base, ) completion = client.chat.completions.create( model=\"meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct\", messages = [ {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a helpful assistant.\"}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Which country is San Francisco in?\"} ], extra_body={ \"guided_json\": json_schema, \"guided_decoding_backend\": \"lm-format-enforcer\" } ) print(\"Completion result:\", completion) If you run the above code, you will get the response following the format specified in the json_schema. After you have successfully deployed vllm, you can set the following configurations in TaskWeaver: { \"llm.model\": \"meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct\", \"llm.api_base\": \"http://localhost:8000/v1\", \"llm.api_key\": \"null\", \"llm.api_type\": \"openai\", \"llm.openai.require_alternative_roles\": false, \"llm.openai.support_system_role\": true } The llm.openai.require_alternative_roles and llm.openai.support_system_role configurations are discussed in the OpenAI Configuration page. With these configurations, TaskWeaver will send the messages to the vllm server and get the responses.","s":"Constrained Generation","u":"/TaskWeaver/blog/local_llm","h":"#constrained-generation","p":20},{"i":27,"t":"In order to support the constrained generation in TaskWeaver, we need to provide the schema to the model. Therefore, we made a few changes in the code to support this feature. First, we add a response_json_schema field to the planner and code interpreter. For planner, you can find it in taskweaver/planner/planner_prompt.py. It looks like this: response_json_schema: |- { \"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": { \"response\": { \"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": { \"init_plan\": { \"type\": \"string\" }, \"plan\": { \"type\": \"string\" }, \"current_plan_step\": { \"type\": \"string\" }, \"send_to\": { \"type\": \"string\" }, \"message\": { \"type\": \"string\" } }, \"required\": [ \"init_plan\", \"plan\", \"current_plan_step\", \"send_to\", \"message\" ] } }, \"required\": [\"response\"] } If you are familiar with the previous output schema, you may notice that we have changed the response field to an object from an array of elements. This is because that it is much easier to express the schema in JSON format if the properties are in an object, not elements in an array. Correspondingly, we add a response_json_schema field to the code interpreter. You can find it in taskweaver/code_interpreter/code_interpreter/code_generator_prompt.py, which looks like this: response_json_schema: |- { \"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": { \"response\": { \"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": { \"thought\": { \"type\": \"string\" }, \"reply_type\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"enum\": [\"python\", \"text\"] }, \"reply_content\": { \"type\": \"string\" } }, \"required\": [\"thought\", \"reply_type\", \"reply_content\"] } }, \"required\": [\"response\"] } We also change the response field to an object from an array of elements in the code interpreter. A benefit of this change is that we can now easily restrict the reply_type field to only two values: python and text, which is not possible before. One consequence of this change is that we need to modify the examples for the code interpreter in order to support the new schema. The old examples contain attachments that have the types of python, text, and sample, which are deprecated. We now need to change them to the new schema. Specifically, we need to change the type field to reply_type and the content field to reply_content. For example, the old example: - type: python content: |- file_path = \"/abc/def.txt\" with open(file_path, \"r\") as file: file_contents = file.read() print(file_contents) should be changed to: - type: reply_type content: python # or 'text' if the old type is 'text' or 'sample' - type: reply_content content: |- file_path = \"/abc/def.txt\" with open(file_path, \"r\") as file: file_contents = file.read() print(file_contents) There could be multiple thought attachments in the code interpreter examples. But in the new schema, there is only one thought field. So we have added code to do the conversion and no manual work is needed to modify the examples. If you have examples, after these changes, we can now support the constrained generation in TaskWeaver. Second, we submit the JSON schema to the model when we need to call the endpoint, which you can find in planner.py and code_generator.py, respectively.","s":"How we implemented the constrained generation in TaskWeaver","u":"/TaskWeaver/blog/local_llm","h":"#how-we-implemented-the-constrained-generation-in-taskweaver","p":20},{"i":29,"t":"In this blog post, we have introduced a new feature called \"Constrained Generation\" that can enforce the model to generate responses following the format.

For the Planner and CodeInterpreter roles, you can configure the experience directory by setting the planner.experience_dir and code_interpreter.experience_dir fields respectively. The default experience directory is experience in the project directory. info The role name is by default the name of the implementation file (without the extension) of the role unless you have specified the role name by calling _set_name in the implementation file. By configuring different experience directories for different roles, you can have different experiences for different roles in a static way.

In TaskWeaver, although we retrieve the experience based on the query content, it is sometimes difficult to obtain the right experience based solely on the similarity between the query content and the experience content. One real example we encountered is that we need to retrieve the experience based on the task type. We have many task types in the project, let's say task_type_1, task_type_2, and task_type_3. Every task type is about following a set of instructions to complete a task. Although different task types have different instructions, the instructions are similar in structure. For example, they all have similar steps like step_1, step_2, and step_3, only the content of the steps is slightly different for different task types. Actually, even most of the step titles are the same for different task types. Each task type has its own experience, and we want to select the experience based on the task type. Even though we can mix all the experiences into one experience directory, it is very hard to differentiate the experiences based on the user input or the step content. In this project, the user input is simply a task ID, and we need to first figure out the task type based on the task ID, and then select the experience based on the task type. To achieve this, we add a layer in the experience selection process. Specifically, we allow having subdirectories in the experience directory. For example, we can have the following experience directory structure: planner_experience ├── task_type_1 │ ├── exp_1.yaml │ ├── exp_2.yaml │ └── ... When we can identify the task type based on the task ID, we can set the experience subdirectory. This looks straightforward, but how can we set the experience subdirectory in TaskWeaver? As we need to do this in a dynamic way, the only way is to set the experience subdirectory in a role. TaskWeaver recently introduced the concept of shared memory as discussed in Shared Memory. Shared memory allows a role to share information with other roles, and in this case, we can use shared memory to set the experience subdirectory. We can add a new role called TaskTypeIdentifier to identify the task type based on the task ID. The key part of the reply function in TaskTypeIdentifier is shown below: def reply(self, memory: Memory, **kwargs: ...) -> Post: # ... # get the task type from the last post message task_type = get_task_type(last_post.message) # create an attachment post_proxy.update_attachment( type=AttachmentType.shared_memory_entry, message=\"Add experience sub path\", extra=SharedMemoryEntry.create( type=\"experience_sub_path\", scope=\"conversation\", # define the effective scope of the shared memory entry to be the whole conversation content=\"task_type_1\", ), ) return post_proxy.end() In a role that needs to set the experience subdirectory, we can get the experience subdirectory from the shared memory. exp_sub_paths = memory.get_shared_memory_entries( entry_type=\"experience_sub_path\", ) if exp_sub_paths: exp_sub_path = exp_sub_paths[0].content else: exp_sub_path = \"\" selected_experiences = self.load_experience(query=query, sub_path=exp_sub_path) tip This is the current experimental feature in TaskWeaver which is subject to change.","s":"Dynamic experience selection","u":"/TaskWeaver/blog/experience","h":"#dynamic-experience-selection","p":30},{"i":37,"t":"In this blog post, we have discussed how to select experiences in TaskWeaver.

The term \"code-first\" means that the agent is designed to convert the user's request into one or multiple runnable code snippets and then execute them to generate the response. The philosophy behind this design is to consider programming languages as the de facto language for communication in cyber-physical systems, just like the natural language for human communication. Therefore, TaskWeaver translates the user's request in natural language into programming languages, which can be executed by the system to perform the desired tasks. Under this design, when the developer needs to extend the agent's capability, they can write a new plugin. A plugin is a piece of code wrapped in a class that can be called as a function by the agent in the generated code snippets. Let's consider an example: the agent is asked to load a CSV file and perform anomaly detection on the data. The workflow of the agent is in the diagram below. It is very natural to represent data to be processed in variables and this task in code snippets. However, we do find challenges for other tasks that are not naturally represented in code snippets. Let's consider another example: the agent is asked to read a manual and follow the instructions to process the data. We first assume there is a plugin that can read the manual and extract the instructions, called read_manual. The workflow of the agent is in the diagram below. This diagram only shows the first step of the task, which is to read the manual and extract the instructions. Although it does obtain the instructions, and the agent can follow them to complete the task, the behavior of the agent is less natural compared to the previous example. Why? First, there is no need to generate code to read the manual and extract the instructions. Once the Planner has decided to read the manual, the code to extract the instructions is straightforward. Even though that there might be dynamic parts in the code such as some arguments in the function read_manual, it could be handled by the Planner. Therefore, the Code Generator is not necessary in this case, and the current flow actually incurred unnecessary LLM call overhead to generate the code snippets. Second, it does not make sense to represent the instructions in variables. The instructions are not data to be processed, but a text guide for the agent to follow. For these reasons, we introduced the concept of roles in TaskWeaver. Roles are actually not new in TaskWeaver as there are already roles like Planner and CodeInterpreter. To add a new role, the developer can follow the documentation here. In general, a role is a class that inherits the Role class and implements the reply method. The reply method is the function that the agent calls to interact with the role, which has the following signature: def reply(self, memory: Memory, **kwargs) -> Post: # implementation It takes the memory object, which is the memory of the agent, and returns a Post object, which is the response of the role to the Planner. With the memory object, the role can access the history of the conversation and the context of the conversation. You may have noticed that all roles in TaskWeaver can only talk to the Planner, not to each other. If a role needs to talk to another role, it should go through the Planner. This design is to ensure that the Planner can control the conversation and the flow of the conversation. For a task that requires multiple roles to work together, the Planner can orchestrate the roles to work together to complete the task as shown in the diagram below. The communication between the Planner and the roles is done through the Post object. In other words, they talk to each other by sending messages in natural language. What if a role needs to send some data to another role? If this is the case, we would recommend to implement a new plugin instead of a new role. Otherwise, you may need to store the data in an external storage like a database and let the other role to access it. In summary, the concept of roles in TaskWeaver is to provide a way to extend the agent's capability by implementing new roles. This is especially useful when the task is not naturally represented in code snippets such as acquire text information from a knowledge base or the internet. Implementing a new role is straightforward by inheriting the Role class and implementing the reply method. All extra roles should be put in the TaskWeaver/taskweaver/ext_role folder, which will be automatically loaded by TaskWeaver. We have provided a few sample roles in the TaskWeaver/taskweaver/ext_role folder, such as the Echo role that echoes the user's message back to the user.
